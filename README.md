# Data-Cleaning-Preprocessing-
In this project, we worked with the Titanic dataset and focused on cleaning the data to get it ready for future analysis or machine learning. We handled missing values, converted text columns (like where passengers boarded) into numbers using one-hot encoding, and made sure the data is in a clean, structured format.
