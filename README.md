# Data-Cleaning-Preprocessing-
In this project, we worked with the Titanic dataset and focused on cleaning the data to get it ready for future analysis or machine learning. We handled missing values, converted text columns (like where passengers boarded) into numbers using one-hot encoding, and made sure the data is in a clean, structured format.

## What We Did

- Loaded the Titanic dataset
- Explored the data to understand missing values and column types
- Cleaned the dataset by:
  - Handling missing values
  - Encoding categorical columns like `Embarked` using one-hot encoding
  - Dropping unnecessary or unused columns

## Goal

To prepare a clean, structured version of the Titanic dataset that is ready for analysis or machine learning models.

##  Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook
